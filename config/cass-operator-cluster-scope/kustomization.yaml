# This provides support for configuring and deploying cass-operator with cluster scope
# alongside k8ssandra-operator. We aren't using the kustomizations from the cass-operator
# repo because they deploy cass-operator to the cass-operator namespace and we want to
# be able to deploy to a different namespace, namely the k8ssandra-operator namespace.
#
# This kustomization needs to be used with another one that creates a namespace so that
# the subject's namespace in the ClusterRoleBindings are configured correctly.
